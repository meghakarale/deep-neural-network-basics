# Deep Neural Network Tutorial for Beginners

This repository provides a beginner-friendly walkthrough of building a Deep Neural Network (DNN) using **TensorFlow and Keras**.

We use the **MNIST dataset** of handwritten digits to demonstrate:
- Neural network architecture (input, hidden, output layers)
- Model creation with Keras
- Data normalization and one-hot encoding
- Model training and evaluation
- Predictions on test data
